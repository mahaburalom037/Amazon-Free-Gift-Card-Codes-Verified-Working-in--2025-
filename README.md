What is an Amazon Free Code Generator?
An Amazon Free Code Generator is a tool or website that supposedly provides users with free Amazon gift card codes without requiring any payment. These generators claim to generate valid Amazon codes that can be redeemed for store credit, allowing users to shop for free.

Are Amazon Free Code Generators Legitimate?
The short answer is no. Amazon does not support or authorize any free code generators. All legitimate Amazon gift cards come directly from Amazon itself, authorized retailers, or official promotions. Websites or apps promising to generate free gift card codes are usually scams designed to:

Steal your personal information
Infect your device with malware or viruses
Trick you into completing surveys or downloading apps for no actual reward
Gain access to your Amazon account
Amazon has a highly secure system that prevents fake or randomly generated codes from being used. If a generator claims to bypass Amazonâ€™s security, it is most likely a fraudulent scheme.
